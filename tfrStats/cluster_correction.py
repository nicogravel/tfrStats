# Correct the p-values for multiple comparisons using cluster correction
def cluster_correction(stats, cluster_size, alpha):

    """
    Get p-values from min-max null distribution

    This functions computes distances between all time-frequency bins, pool p-vals 
    of nearest neighbours based on distance threshold (defined by cluster size), tests
    that a time-frequency is below alpha and its neighbours p-vals below alpha, and if
    true, average the p-values within the cluster and assign the resulting average as
    corrected p-value to the time-frequency bin. 

    
    Args:
        stats: un-corrected p-values for each frequency and time bin

    Returns:

        stats: corrected p-values for each frequency and time bin
